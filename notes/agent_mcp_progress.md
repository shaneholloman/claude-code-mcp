# MCP Agent Tool Progress Report

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented a TypeScript MCP server for agent management that follows the correct patterns and practices from existing MCP servers. The implementation is currently in the prototype stage in the `playground/agent-mcp/` directory.

## Implementation Details

1. **TypeScript with ES Modules**
   - Configured properly with `"type": "module"` in package.json
   - Using `NodeNext` module resolution
   - Using `.js` extensions in import paths

2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
   - Using `Server` from the SDK with proper configuration
   - Implementing `ListToolsRequestSchema` and `CallToolRequestSchema` handlers
   - Following content formatting conventions for responses

3. **Agent Operations**
   - Create agents with custom instructions
   - Run agents with Claude API integration
   - Monitor agent status
   - List and filter agents

4. **Claude API Integration**
   - Integrated with Claude API for executing agent instructions
   - Proper environment variable handling for API key
   - Response parsing and error handling

5. **Production-Ready Features**
   - Structured logging with configurable levels
   - Custom error classes
   - Comprehensive error handling

## Testing Challenges

Our testing efforts revealed several challenges with testing MCP servers:

1. **Stdio Transport Issues**
   - The MCP SDK's stdio transport has unique handling that makes direct testing difficult
   - Standard Node.js process communication methods are incompatible with the MCP server's request processing
   - Simple subprocess management techniques are insufficient for reliable testing

2. **Testing Approaches Attempted**
   - Direct stdin/stdout manipulation in Node.js
   - Named pipes for communication
   - Subprocess with I/O redirection
   - Echo-based testing with custom middlewares

3. **Test Scripts Created**
   - `test-client.js`: Attempted to use direct process I/O
   - `debug-standalone.js`: Simplified MCP-like server for debugging
   - `e2b-test.js`: Attempted to use E2B for isolated testing
   - `mcp-integration-test.js`: Documentation of proper testing approach

These challenges led us to explore a containerized approach for testing MCP servers.

## Docker MCP Manager Approach

After encountering testing challenges, we've designed a Docker-based approach for managing and testing MCP servers:

1. **Container Isolation**
   - Each MCP server runs in its own Docker container
   - Clean environment with proper configuration
   - Resource management and monitoring

2. **Server Management**
   - API for creating, starting, stopping containers
   - Log aggregation and monitoring
   - Health checks and status tracking

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Automated test sequences
   - Result collection and reporting
   - Integration with other MCP servers

A comprehensive design document has been created at `notes/docker_mcp_manager_design.md`.

## Next Steps

1. **Docker MCP Implementation**
   - Implement the core container management functionality
   - Create Dockerfile templates for MCP servers
   - Build the API for container operations

2. **Agent Server Refinement**
   - Optimize for containerized deployment
   - Add test mode for simulated operation
   - Improve error handling and recovery

3. **Testing Implementation**
   - Create Docker-based test framework
   - Implement automated test sequences
   - Develop reporting and visualization

4. **Migration to Production**
   - After thorough testing, move to `mcp-servers/agent/`
   - Add to Claude's server configuration
   - Document production deployment process

## Lessons Learned

1. **MCP Server Implementation Patterns**
   - ES modules configuration is critical
   - Request handling with `setRequestHandler` must follow specific patterns
   - Content formatting conventions must be followed precisely
   - Error handling needs to be comprehensive

2. **Testing Considerations**
   - MCP servers require specialized testing approaches
   - Direct I/O manipulation is insufficient
   - Containerization provides better isolation and reliability
   - Proper transport layer handling is essential

3. **Best Practices Discovered**
   - Structured logging with configurable levels
   - Custom error classes for better error handling
   - Clear response formatting
   - Containerization for deployment and testing

We've updated CLAUDE.md with these best practices to ensure consistent implementation across future MCP servers.
