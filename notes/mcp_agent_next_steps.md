# MCP Agent Tool - Next Steps

## Current Status

We've created a prototype implementation of an MCP Agent tool in the `playground/agent-mcp/` directory. The current implementation includes:

- Agent management data model with appropriate schemas
- Operations for creating, running, retrieving, and listing agents
- In-memory storage for agents with state transitions
- Error handling infrastructure
- Documentation of usage patterns

## Implementation Challenges

During testing, we encountered some challenges with the MCP SDK integration:

1. **SDK Compatibility**: The MCP SDK has undergone changes that make it difficult to integrate without deeper understanding of the internals.
2. **Module System**: Differences between CommonJS and ES modules added complexity to the build process.
3. **Type Definitions**: There were inconsistencies between the SDK's published types and actual interfaces.

## Recommended Next Steps

To move forward with the MCP Agent tool, we recommend the following steps:

### 1. Study Current MCP Servers

- Take time to study the current MCP servers in more detail, especially focusing on one of the simpler TypeScript implementations
- Understand the specific patterns used for request/response handling
- Investigate how the SDK is being imported and used

### 2. Prototype Using Template

- Create a new prototype based directly on one of the working MCP servers
- Start with minimal functionality and build up incrementally
- Focus on getting the server running before adding all features

### 3. Agent Implementation

- Once the basic server is working, implement the agent capabilities
- Start with simple in-memory storage
- Gradually add the ability to spawn actual sub-agents for testing

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Create a dedicated test suite for the agent tool
- Include tests for each endpoint
- Test integration with other MCP tools

### 5. Production Implementation

- After successful prototyping, move the implementation to the mcp-servers directory
- Add proper persistence
- Document thoroughly

## Benefits of This Approach

The Agent MCP tool provides several benefits:

1. **Self-Testing**: Claude can test its own MCP tools without manual intervention
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing reduces the risk of regressions
3. **Extensibility**: The agent concept could be expanded for other automation tasks
4. **Demonstration**: Shows Claude's ability to create and use its own tools

By taking a methodical approach to implementation, we can ensure that the Agent MCP tool becomes a robust part of Claude's capabilities.
